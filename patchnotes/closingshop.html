    <h1>Closing Shop</h1>

    <blockquote><b>tl;dr</b> Shutting down a disfunctional company is healthy and founders should dare not wait until
        the last possible hour because that's good for everyone. You can do it much faster in Germany if you use the <a
            href="#ap">accelerated process.</a></blockquote>
    <p>
        The first company I started in Germany in 2013 failed. runpat.com was SaaS Tool to visualize and tinker with
        business
        ideas, inspired by business process modeling. I met my two co-founders at university through my bachelor thesis
        mentor. Back then the business model canvas and lean startup methodology were at peak hype and my thesis
        discussed how to capture business ideas in a more formal way as well defined models, literal business models. My
        thesis mentor had an entrepreneurial background himself and asked me if I wanted to turn my thesis into a
        company. I said sure why not, not knowing much about what that actually meant. Reflecting on that moment, I'm
        always a bit astonished at how nonchalantly I started my journey as a founder. Then again I guess a lot of tech
        founders have similar stories. After quickly building the first alpha version, which in retrospect it
        was, we launched it. And by launch I mean we published the tool and the website and waited for the
        streams of users to come in. Or at least that's what we implicitly expected looking back. Just building stuff is
        not enough, you have to get it out there. Technically and awareness-wise. After launching the first version we
        raised our first-ever capital, 100K € from a local, semi-public investor. Without valuation, as a silent
        partnership with interest payments. After the great growth from our business plan did not come to pass, with
        raised another 100K € under the condition, that each founder would put up another 10K € privately to "share the
        risk and increase commitment". I would not do something like that again. Firstly, the founders are already more
        than committed. If not, the company is doomed anyway and no amount will change that. Secondly: As a founder, you
        already invest your time (and lots of it) in the company. You forgo potential jobs, other opportunities, time
        spend with friends and family as well as a good chunk of zen in your life. Additionally putting in money (other
        basic starting capital) overextends you and is not a reasonable ask from investors. Especially german business
        angels like the view "why should I risk my money, if you don't". My advice for founders is: If you meet an
        investor like this, stay away. Investors that don't understand, that the value of the founder comes from their
        time and ambition are not a good addition to your cap table. After the second 100K € plus our 30K € in new
        runway did not bring the desired result and one of my co-founders quit we decided to shut down the company.
        Especially new
        founders think of this scenario as a kind of catastrophe: You failed your investors, partners, and customers and
        are a
        complete loser in the eyes of everybody that knows you. Of course, this is not remotely true. Shutting down not
        functioning companies is healthy. Not putting endless time, money, and passion into things that do not work is
        healthy. Not feeling bad after you made a professional business decision is healthy. Of course, shutting down
        can
        be, and often is, an emotional issue. And that's fine, as long as it does not distract you from one fact: You
        are stopping something that is not working in order to do something that does. As the last remaining founder and
        CEO it was my job to wind down the company. I can truly say, that I was pretty zen with the act. The talks with
        my co-founders were a bit intense, for we all lacked the experience of what was actually happening and as most
        first-time founders do, we felt the impact of our company way bigger than it was in hindsight. We had a handful
        of users, none of which relied on the tool very much, an investment, that was half subsidy from the state and
        much less
        marketing reach and interest, than we admitted. While this may sound bleak, I find it quite comforting, that
        things that don't work tend to gather less traction and therefore limit the impact of failure for all involved.
        I was actually surprised by how little impact our failure actually had. Nobody in my private circle was shocked
        or cared too much for that matter. Put in one word, the response would have been mostly "huh". All in all, after
        deciding to shut down, I was in good spirit because the weight of an unsuccessful project was gone together with
        a long to-do list. I can't remember where I read it<a href="#f1">[1]</a>, but there is a quote that stuck with
        me
        through this rather anticlimatic experience:

    <blockquote>"What at first seems like the end of the world often turns out to be a positive, transforming
        experience."</blockquote>

    Personally, I never felt the famous lack of german failure culture. Most people I talked to were really nice or
    understanding about it and mostly neutral. There are a few technicals I wanted to share for a long time. There are 3
    different ways in Germany to shut down a company (GmbH or UG):

    <ul>
        <li>Insolvency</li>
        If you run out of money or don't have a reasonable perspective to avoid it you have to declare insolvency. In
        this case, all payments are stopped immediately and the fate of the company is put in the hands of an appointed
        insolvency manager. While this is not ideal, it sometimes is necessary. Depending on if the companies can be
        saved or not it can be very complex. <b>In this case and CEO you don't have agency anymore and are that the
            risk your every current and past move is scrutinized.</b>
        <li>Default 12 Month Liquidation</li>
        If you are in a position where you still have money, you can decide on a controlled shutdown of the company,
        called a liquidation. Your shareholder decides this formally a appoint a liquidator, tasked with winding down
        the
        company. This is what we did. The liquidator ends all business relationships and makes sure, everybody gets what
        they are owed. Best case you still have enough money to satisfy everybody. we had enough, of course just not for
        the return on the investment. In this case, the investor formally waived all claims and the company was square.
        In the normal liquidation process, there is a one-year waiting period, where potential debtors can claim money
        from the company. After the the company is deleted from the register is completely gone. <b>While preferable
            since you can manage the winding down yourself, this is still not ideal. It takes quite long until
            everything is completely done formally.</b>
        <li id="ap">3 Month Liquidation<a href="#f2">[2]</a></li>
        This is the version I did not know about and neither our tax advisor nor notary did not tell me. If the company
        is doing a planned shutdown, but no money will be left to distribute anyway, one can skip the waiting period.
        <b>It is important to select this process when the liquidation is registered</b>. It is not possible to do
        this, after starting the process, which I tried for our GmbH, as soon as I learned this was a thing. The only
        thing needed for this, apart from the formalities already required for the slow Version the only thing you need
        is a guarantee by the appointed liquidator that there will be no money left to distribute to the shareholders<a
            href="#f3">[3]</a>.
    </ul>

    The final point I like to make is this: When you are in the trenches and fighting for your startup you just take it
    day by day. Since just not dying<a href="f4">[4]</a> is a solid strategy it is in the nature of things to postpone
    considering shutting down until the last second. Worst case: The company implodes at that point to the detriment of
    all involved. Employees are let go on very short notice, customers need to find alternatives very fast and
    partners have to rapidly adapt plans if they are involved in the company. Since this is always a complicated
    situation
    there is no easy advice to be had. Especially since in most cases, the failure is not 100% absolute. What I would
    like to postulate is this:

    <b>Founders should dare not to wait until the last possible moment to shut down a doomed company. Do it
        a bit sooner and give your partners, customers, and your team time to adapt to the new reality.</b> Give your
    team
    this time to find new jobs and land on their feet, give your customers time to search for alternatives and migrate
    their data with your help and give your partners a chance to find a replacement for you in critical projects. Every
    founder doing this should be regarded as highly professional and be told so, for most founders' greatest fear is the
    accusation of not pushing hard enough. If you are going through something like this, this too shall pass. Wrap it up
    and go do something new and much more awesome. The future looks bright.
